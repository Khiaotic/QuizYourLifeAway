Created a mostly javascript ran Quiz application. The app is timed and gauges progress . When you click the start button  the  quiz will start, each  answered question will take you to the  next.
When an  answer is wrong time is  subtracted. The quiz is over when the timer equals zeo  or all the questions have been answered. Client will then input initials and see final score.
